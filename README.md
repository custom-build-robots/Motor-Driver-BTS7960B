# Motor-Driver-BTS7960B
This is a Python program to control two BTS7960B H-Bridge with a Raspberry Pi. I developed this Python program for my Raspberry Pi robot BigRob which uses four DC motors and two BTS7960B H-Bridges.

To test the Python program "BTS7960BHBridge.py" use the "RobotControl.py" program from my repository https://github.com/custom-build-robots/Motor-Driver-L298N.

## Project Homepage
This is my project homepage which describes how to build the Big Rob robot and how to use the python program to control the BTS7960B H-Bridge:
